                       <p>Hello Namaste Salam to everyone. First of all I want to say thank you for loving my project and supporting me always.<br> Am <strong>deepak</strong> from India, born on december, 1991 and am a <strong>software developer</strong>. I am post graduated in <strong>MCA (Master of computer application)</strong> from <strong>IGNOU (Indra Gandhi National Open University)</strong>. I was the big fan of <strong>nimbuzz</strong> before. I joined in 2008 using my yahoo account. Nimbuzz was the platform where I started learn coding and IT skills. I <strong>prefered</strong> to learned <strong>java</strong> because <strong>java is most secure, free and can run in all operating system</strong> though its very complicated and tuff. I believe there is <strong>nothing impossible</strong> it's just matter of time how fast you grab and understand the logic. I believe in <strong>hard work and focus we can achieve anything</strong>.</p>

                   <h4>Definition</h4>
                   <p>Hoivia is <strong>"hoi"</strong> (means Hi) and <strong>"via"</strong> (Through). So it's mean you are connected someone through hoivia. I know most of us says Hi. But i found when you speak english accent then it's sound like "hoi".</p>
                   <p>Some says when you fall in love with someone and you have strong love feelings then you see them everywhere around you even when they are not with you or they are not talking with you. via word i taken from a girl whom I love in this galaxy. so hoivia is also dedicated to her. You can live with anybody, you can settle with anyone. But the person whom you loves never leaves you alone.</p>
