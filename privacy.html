                  <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service, the hoivia app.</p>
                  <p>Hoivia, a messaging application which allows for one-on-one chat, group messaging, and multimedia sharing in real-time.</p>

                  <br>
                  <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
                  <p>For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your name, phone number, and postal address. The information that we collect will be used to contact or identify you.</p>

                  <h4>1. Messages.</h4>
                  <p>
                     The Application may be used to send messages between users of the Application. If you send a message to one or more other user(s), we will retain the message, the sender and recipient data, and associate it with your phone number or account.
                  </p>
                  <br> 
                  <h4>2. Picture, video, and data sharing.</h4>
                  <p>
                     The Application may be used to send pictures, videos, audio files, and data on any user’s location (“Media File(s)”), between users of the Application. If you send any such Media File to one or more other user(s), we will retain such file or data on your behalf and disclose it to the intended recipient(s).

                     The Application allows you to send Media Files to more than one user at a time by sending any such Media File to a chatroom of users (“chatroom”). You can create chatroom by inviting other users or be invited to a chatroom. Once a user is added to a conversation/chatroom, such user will receive all messages and Media Files sent by you as part of that conversation.
